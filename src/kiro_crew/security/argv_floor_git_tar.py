"""The git/tar self-target floor: a git or tar command that dials this host is refused.

The ssh self-target floor (``argv_floor_ssh``) reads the ssh-family verbs ``ssh``,
``scp``, ``sftp`` and ``rsync``.  Programs that start an ssh transport on their own are
not those verbs, so an agent can re-enter this same host, outside the sandbox mounts,
through them: ``git clone localhost:x`` scp-dials the local sshd, ``git fetch
ssh://127.0.0.1/x`` the same over a URL, ``git clone ext::ssh localhost id`` runs a
command that dials it, ``git -c core.sshCommand='ssh localhost' clone far:x`` redirects
every ssh to this host, and ``tar -cf localhost:out.tar dir`` rsh-dials it.  This floor
reads a git or tar command line -- behind env/wrapper unwrapping, quoting, ``user@``
prefixes, URI schemes, globs and the same shell expansions the ssh floor resolves -- and
refuses it when a transport operand names this host (the same ``argv_floor_hosts``
self-host test the ssh floor uses) or when a command the transport runs DIALS this host
(``git ext::``, a ``core.sshCommand`` / ``GIT_SSH`` / ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` override, ``tar
--rsh-command`` / ``TAR_OPTIONS`` / ``TAPE``, an ``--upload-pack`` /
``--receive-pack`` program): that value must name
a literal self host and be read as a command line that dials it by the ssh floor's
``_is_ssh_to_self``, the way it reads rsync's ``-e``.  Such a command runs in the agent's
own sandbox, so one that does not dial this host is no escape and stays allowed.  It
FAILS CLOSED on a transport argument it cannot parse.

A git/tar remote host, and a host named in such a command value, is refused only when it
is a LITERAL self address (loopback names and addresses, this host's own cached
names/addresses), with no DNS or hosts-file alias lookup, so a first-seen dotted remote
such as ``github.com`` or a ProxyJump bastion is never pending-refused.  A remote host is
read as typed: git and tar never glob-expand it, so ``*:*`` or ``local*:x`` names no self
host (globs are read in the PROGRAM word, ``g*t``, and inside a command value, which a
shell runs and expands: ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh local*'`` is still refused).  A dotted name that resolves to
THIS host through an alias is the documented residual for git/tar: the ssh floor still
covers ssh/scp, and the OS network fence is the fix of record.

Deliberately NOT refused: normal local use -- ``git add``/``commit``/``status``/``log``/
``diff``, ``git clone /local/path``, ``git clone https://…`` (http(s)/git/ftp is not an
ssh-or-exec escape), ``git fetch origin`` with a remote that is not this host, ``tar
-czf x.tgz dir``, ``tar -xf x.tar``, and file-operand globs (``git add s* *.*``, ``tar
-czf handoff.tgz s* *.*``).

``kiro_crew.security.argv_floor`` serves every name defined here, and a patch through it
reaches this module (:mod:`kiro_crew._facade_mirror`).  It reads a command line through
the ssh floor's own front end -- its source pre-walk (``_ssh_floor_source_text``), its
nested-payload frames and its environment tracker (``_FrameEnvironment``) -- and uses
the ssh floor's operand resolver, the host verdicts in ``argv_floor_hosts``, and the
shell reader.  A new shell normalization goes in the ssh floor, which both floors read;
a new git/tar transport spelling goes here.
